# MIPS-Processor-Simulation
Verilog-based Pipelined MIPS Processor Simulation.

This project is still in its nascent stage. The simulation works fine for now, but probably can be optimized in many ways.

## Usage
The entire simulation can be tested by simulating the `MIPSStimulus.v` file using `ModelSim`.

## Documentation
Most of the codebase has inline comments added, and follows from the standard 5-stage MIPS pipeline as follows:

## Additional
Suggestions and Pull Requests are always welcome, as I'm just a beginner in the field of `Verilog` programming.
